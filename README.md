## About Me

I’m a software engineer and Computer Science student at the University of California, Los Angeles (Class of 2026), focused on infrastructure, distributed systems, and developer platforms.

I am an incoming software engineer on the platforms team at Coinbase, and I have prior software engineering experience at GitHub. At Github, I worked on large-scale backend systems and developer-facing infrastructure. My interests center on usage tracking and billing primitives, reliability challenges in distributed environments, and designing systems where pricing, limits, and cost attribution are first-class concerns.

I enjoy working across backend systems and data-heavy applications, with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and operational simplicity. I’m particularly interested in how advances in networking and machine learning are reshaping developer productivity.

## Interests

- Distributed systems and backend infrastructure  
- Billing, metering, and cost attribution systems  
- Reliability, coordination, and fault tolerance  
- Developer tooling and platform engineering
