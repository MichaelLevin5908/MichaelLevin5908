## About Me

I’m a software engineer and Computer Science student at the University of California, Los Angeles (Class of 2026), focused on infrastructure, distributed systems, and developer platforms.

My interests center on large-scale systems design, usage tracking and billing primitives, and the reliability challenges that arise in highly distributed environments. I enjoy working across backend systems and data-heavy applications, with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and operational simplicity.

I’m particularly interested in how pricing, limits, and cost attribution become first-class concerns in modern software systems, as well as how advances in networking and machine learning are reshaping developer productivity.

## Interests

- Distributed systems and backend infrastructure  
- Billing, metering, and cost attribution systems  
- Reliability, coordination, and fault tolerance  
- Developer tooling and platform engineering  
- Applied mathematics and systems design  

## Personal

- Weightlifting and strength training  
- Global history and strategy-based board games  
- Studying modern defense systems and resilience-driven design
